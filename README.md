# Basic-operations-
This is a basic operations of computer for any windows and any linux

This code requires administrator. This code has functions which can sleep, shutdown, reboot your computer. This code uses python 3. If you run this on Python 2.7, some code won't work. You can choose the code which operating system are you using. Hope you can support me by sending me a python script file :)
