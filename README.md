# Basic-operations

Hello everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

This is Basic operations for Windows and Linux. For Mac, maybe it is similar to [Linux](https://github.com/Inspector3ug/Basic-operations/blob/main/basic_operations_for_linux.py) and it requires Python 3. If you run with Python 2, some code won't work. But I recommend you to use [Python 3.10.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/). 

**Notes:**

For Windows, it requires to run as administrator but I recommend you to run [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as administrator. Then run the code as usual in the code editor
